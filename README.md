# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Bernoulli-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Text sentiment analysis using a Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier. This project provides a practical implementation of sentiment analysis, helping  understand and classify sentiment in text data efficiently. 


## Features

- **Sentiment Classification:** Utilizes Bernoulli Naive Bayes to classify text sentiment.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data preprocessing steps like text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the performance of the sentiment analysis model using various metrics.
- **Example Usage:** Provides examples and a simple user interface to test the sentiment analysis on your own text data. 

##Steps performed:

- downloading data 
- labeling the data (we already have this too)
- cleaning and normalizing the text
- tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
- feature extraction
- classification
